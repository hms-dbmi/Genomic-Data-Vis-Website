abstract: "Whole genome alignments and comparative analysis are key methods in the quest of unraveling the dynamics of genome evolution. Interactive visualization and exploration of the generated alignments, annotations, and phylogenetic data are important steps in the interpretation of the initial results. Limitations of existing software inspired us to develop our new tool AliTV, which provides interactive visualization of whole genome alignments. AliTV reads multiple whole genome alignments or automatically generates alignments from the provided data. Optional feature annotations and phylo- genetic information are supported. The user-friendly, web-browser based and highly customizable interface allows rapid exploration and manipulation of the visualized data as well as the export of publication-ready high-quality figures. AliTV is freely available at https://github.com/AliTVTeam/AliTV."
